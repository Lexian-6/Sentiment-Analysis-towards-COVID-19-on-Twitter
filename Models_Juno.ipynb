Upon careful inspection, it was discovered that the original dataset contained a significant number of incorrect labels. These erroneous labels can adversely affect the performance and evaluation of our models, leading to misleading results.\n",

This step ensures that the dataset is more accurate and reliable, providing a robust foundation for training and evaluating our models. By relabeling the data, we aim to achieve more convincing and comparable results across different models used by our team, including LSTM, CLIP encode, and SRN.\n",
